# Greenhouse gas fluxes from small agricultural ponds in the Northern Great Plains 

**Authors:** Jackie R. Webb, Kerri Finlay, Peter R. Leavitt, Gavin L. Simpson, Helen Baulch.

In this report we present the results of a comprehensive survey of 101 agricultural reservoirs (referred to locally as "dugouts") for CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations and flux rates. Despite their small total surface area, the elevated productivity and alkalinity of water bodies in the Prairies make them biogeochemical hot spots for nutrient processing and carbon sequestration (Finlay et al. 2010, 2015). In this research, we aim to quantify the contribution of dugouts to the broader landscape GHG and carbon fluxes. These results will contribute to our global understanding of how managed water bodies in agricultural areas are contributing to landscape carbon and greenhouse gas budgets.
